## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Building instead of selling** ❌
   - Don't spend 4 weeks building the perfect product
   - Launch MVP by day 7
   - Iterate based on customer feedback

2. **No email list** ❌
   - Every visitor should have chance to join email list
   - Email = your biggest asset for future sales
   - Target: 500 subscribers by day 30

3. **Pricing too high or too low** ❌
   - Test multiple price points
   - $9.99–$29.99 SaaS sweet spot for most products
   - Freelance: Charge $1,500–$5,000 minimum

4. **No traffic generation** ❌
   - Website is useless without visitors
   - Must actively push on social media + Product Hunt + communities
   - Expect 50% of time on marketing, 50% on product

5. **Giving up too early** ❌
   - First customer might come on day 28, not day 3
   - Stick with it for full 30 days
   - Month 2 is easier with momentum
